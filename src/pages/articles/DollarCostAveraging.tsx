            Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money
            at regular intervals, regardless of share price. This approach can help reduce the impact of
            volatility on your overall purchase.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">How Dollar-Cost Averaging Works</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            With DCA, you invest the same amount of money on a regular schedule (weekly, monthly, etc.)
            into the same investment. This means you buy:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li className="mb-2">More shares when prices are low</li>
            <li className="mb-2">Fewer shares when prices are high</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Over time, this can lower your average cost per share compared to making a lump-sum investment.
          </p>

          </ul>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Example of Dollar-Cost Averaging</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Let's say you invest $500 monthly in a stock over four months:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-none pl-6 mb-4">
            <li className="mb-2">Month 1: $500 at $50/share = 10 shares</li>
            <li className="mb-2">Month 2: $500 at $40/share = 12.5 shares</li>
            <li className="mb-2">Month 3: $500 at $60/share = 8.33 shares</li>
            <li className="mb-2">Month 4: $500 at $50/share = 10 shares</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Total investment: $2,000<br />
            Total shares: 40.83<br />
            Average cost per share: $49 ($2,000 รท 40.83)<br />
            <br />
            If you had invested $2,000 all at once in Month 1, you would have paid $50 per share.
            Through dollar-cost averaging, you paid an average of $49 per share.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">When to Use Dollar-Cost Averaging</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            DCA is particularly useful:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li className="mb-2">For long-term investors with regular income</li>

            <li className="mb-2">When you're unsure about market direction</li>
